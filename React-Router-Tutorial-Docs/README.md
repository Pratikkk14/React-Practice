# React Router Tutorial Project

This project is based on the official **React Router Docs tutorial**.  
It was created by the React Router team to help developers explore and use some of the amazing features of React Router in real-world projects.

Through this tutorial, I learned many important concepts and techniques that make routing in React applications powerful and efficient.
